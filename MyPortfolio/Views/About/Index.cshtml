    <h2 class="fw-bold" style="color: #D67A31;">Hi! I'm Nicole, a Computer Engineering student.</h2>

    <p class="lead" style="color: #555; max-width: 600px;">
        I'm currently studying at Angeles University Foundation. Over the past three years, We've dived into various programming languages, designed websites, and developed my coding skills.
        When I need to pass the time, you'll probably find me piecing together a jigsaw puzzle, getting lost in a good novel, or binge-watching my favorite dramas.
        I'm always up for a new project or collaboration, so feel free to reach out!
